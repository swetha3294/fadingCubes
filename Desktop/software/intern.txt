Howdy!
My name is Swetha Sridharan. I am a Graduate Student pursuing my Masters in Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University graduating in May 2017. I am currently seeking an internship in the Controls and Automation industry. 
I found your contact information in the Johnson Controls LinkedIn Page. I was wondering if you would have a moment to share with me any advice, ideas, leads or contacts. Any suggestions you could
offer would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time.
Regards,
Swetha Sridharan
